# Airbnb Project
Airbnb is a global online platform that helps travellers to find accomodation and good experiences across the globe. Not only this, Airbnb also encourages hosts to post their listings for rental business and guests to book their stay.

# Use Case 1:
I love to travel. And what would be better than finding an accomodation that suits our needs and our budget. We feel like it is a good idea to analyze the Airbnb dataset to understand what features drive the price of various listings.

# Use Case 2:
While on our vacation away from home, it might be a good idea to list our home on Airbnb to make some extra income. Also, buying a property that can be listed on Airbnb seems like a good investment. Again, analysis of features that drive the price of various listings is important for this.

# Airbnb Data:
Data Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

The above datasets provide detailed Listings data along with availibilty details for each listing. Some of the features that these datasets contain are:

bedrooms: number of bedrooms in a listing

bathrooms: number of bathrooms in a listing

property_type: the type of property (House, Apartment,..., Others)

In this data exploration exercise I will precise the analysis on the Airbnb listings to Seatlle, Washington, United States.
